I've been going through this tutorial: https://github.com/dabit3/aws-appsync-react-workshop#getting-started---creating-the-react-application
And I've been having a great easy time following through the tutorial. But then when I want to apply it towards my type of data I'm trying to build, it just doesn't click.

I'm thinking this is too much to grasp in such a short amount of time and without any expert mentors to help guide me. 
I'm going to abandon using AWS Amplify. 
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/updating-to-new-releases
I copied all contents from our repo and moved it into a separate folder because now I'm restarting the whole repo using the 

npx create-react-app .

Then ran ` npm install `

# Add storybook
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init

npm run storybook

npm install --save react-router-dom

npm install react-bootstrap --save

Then I started composing Multiple React.js components, using https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ for the navbars and footers.

Now, I want to start using React Router, so I'm going to install `npm install -S react-router`

Then we want to install html5 history : `npm install -S history@1`

then run `npm install`  

p.s. all these installations get added to the package.json under dependencies.

Going to continue watching these helpful tutorial videos tomorrow...:

So what I did today was created routes from the home page to my Volleyball page.

I created routes to different components for Volleyball depending on the day of the week.
I then also created some objects of the gyms for Monday and included a Google links that users may click on to navigate to the directions.

Ok I am forgetting here and there to journal here. So I need to make it a goal to keep journaling when I start working on the project. 
Today, I have been researching and asking friends what I should use to build a database of Gyms, and gymevents. My friends recommended 
Postgres DB, Oracle DB. I have been researching on Oracle DB so that's what I am going to start creating today. 

I also added the sportFooter into my volleyball page. I wanted to get the days nav bar in volleyball below the header, but it's really confusing 
how we can efficiently all use the same nav bar, but when clicking on it, leads to our own ComponentDays...

Decided to use PostgresSQL as it's open-source and commonly used. I followed the tutorial link above.
