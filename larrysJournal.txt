I've been going through this tutorial: https://github.com/dabit3/aws-appsync-react-workshop#getting-started---creating-the-react-application
And I've been having a great easy time following through the tutorial. But then when I want to apply it towards my type of data I'm trying to build, it just doesn't click.

I'm thinking this is too much to grasp in such a short amount of time and without any expert mentors to help guide me. 
I'm going to abandon using AWS Amplify. 
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/updating-to-new-releases
I copied all contents from our repo and moved it into a separate folder because now I'm restarting the whole repo using the 

npx create-react-app .

Then ran ` npm install `

# Add storybook
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init

npm run storybook

npm install --save react-router-dom

npm install react-bootstrap --save

Then I started composing Multiple React.js components, using https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ for the navbars and footers.

Now, I want to start using React Router, so I'm going to install `npm install -S react-router`

Then we want to install html5 history : `npm install -S history@1`

then run `npm install`  

p.s. all these installations get added to the package.json under dependencies.

Going to continue watching these helpful tutorial videos tomorrow...:
