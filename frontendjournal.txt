I need to figure out how to build an API. 
Time to educate myself.

So turns out that I can't find a dang Google Maps API that will navigate you smoothly like how Yelp will when you click on the "Directions" button.

I tried https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions

But all it does is show you a grayed out of the directions that driving would take you from point A to point B. It won't actually take you to navigate there based on your GPS.

If there is an API for that, I couldn't find it.
