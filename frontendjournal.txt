I need to figure out how to build an API. 
Time to educate myself.

So turns out that I can't find a dang Google Maps API that will navigate you smoothly like how Yelp will when you click on the "Directions" button.

I tried https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions

But all it does is show you a grayed out of the directions that driving would take you from point A to point B. It won't actually take you to navigate there based on your GPS.

If there is an API for that, I couldn't find it.

Followed this video to deploy on google cloud platform.. 


Here are the steps to deploy the app to Google Cloud:

    `npm run build`
    upload the build folder to the Storage bucket under 'sportspot'
    upload the app.yaml file there too.
    run `gsutil rsync -r gs://sportspot ./sportspots`
    `cd sportspots`
    `gcloud app deploy`


Link to deployed site: https://sportspots-277519.df.r.appspot.com/

Now it'd be nice if everytime I make a change and push up to master that I'd see the change on this deployed website.

Working on axe-react for accessibility changes. Cannot figure out a way to make it better color contrast for the Google calendar exported.

Also the google maps images doesn't come with landmarks. 

Going to see if I can add the Google Address link navigation to the Google map markers.
UPDATE: Yay I'm glad that my friend Brendan asked me about my website. And I talked to him about
how I couldn't find a google map api that would navigate me there. But I did have the googleAddressLink So
I used a window.open(gym.googleAddressLink) to the marker on an OnClick event. 


Added amazon links.
